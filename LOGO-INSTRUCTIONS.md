# Adding the Locked In Logo

To use the awesome gorilla logo in your header:

1. Save the logo image as `locked-in-logo.png` in the `public` folder
2. The image should be saved at: `public/locked-in-logo.png`
3. The app will automatically use the logo in the header
4. If the image isn't found, it will fallback to the text "Locked In"

The logo will be displayed at 64px height (h-16) and will scale proportionally.

## File Structure:
```
public/
  locked-in-logo.png  ← Save your logo here
  manifest.webmanifest
  vite.svg
```

The logo looks amazing and perfectly captures the "Locked In" fitness mindset! 💪
