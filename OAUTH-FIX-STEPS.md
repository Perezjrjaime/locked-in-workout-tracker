# Fix Google OAuth Issues

## Current Issue
Getting "Database error saving new user" when signing in with Google.

## Root Cause
The database trigger was trying to insert minimal user profile data, but our React code was also trying to insert additional fields, causing a conflict.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Updated database trigger to handle all user profile fields
2. ✅ Removed manual profile creation from React code  
3. ✅ Added proper conflict resolution with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Run the Fixed SQL
```sql
-- Copy the contents of fix-user-profiles.sql to Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will update the database trigger to handle user profiles properly
```

### 2. Clear Browser Storage
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Application tab
- Clear Storage for localhost:5174
- This removes any cached auth tokens

### 3. Test Sign-In Again
- Try signing in with Google
- The database trigger should now create the user profile automatically
- No more conflicts or errors

## Expected Result
- ✅ Clean OAuth flow
- ✅ Automatic user profile creation
- ✅ No database errors
- ✅ User can access the app immediately after sign-in

## If Still Having Issues
Check Supabase Auth logs in the dashboard for more detailed error messages.
