# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository: `locked-in-workout-tracker`
5. Add description: "A modern PWA for tracking workouts - weight training, cardio, and history"
6. Make it **Public** (so others can see your work)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/locked-in-workout-tracker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

To host your app for free on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. This will allow you to deploy using GitHub Actions

## Step 4: Set Up Automatic Deployment (Optional)

Create a GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

1. In your repository, create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. This will automatically build and deploy your app when you push changes

## Current Repository Status

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed
✅ Ready to push to GitHub

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. Your app will be backed up safely on GitHub
2. You can collaborate or share your code
3. Set up automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
4. Others can fork and contribute to your project

## Benefits of GitHub Deployment

- **Backup**: Your code is safe in the cloud
- **Version Control**: Track all changes and revert if needed
- **Collaboration**: Others can contribute or fork your project
- **Portfolio**: Showcase your work to potential employers
- **Automatic Deployment**: Deploy updates automatically when you push code

Remember to push your changes regularly to keep your backup up to date!
