# Complete OAuth Fix - Step by Step

## Problem
Getting "Database error saving new user" when signing in with Google OAuth.

## Root Cause
The database trigger was trying to insert into columns that didn't exist in the user_profiles table.

## Solution
We're switching from database triggers to React-based user profile creation for better control and error handling.

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `disable-trigger-fix.sql`
4. Click **Run**

This will:
- ✅ Remove the problematic database trigger
- ✅ Add missing columns to user_profiles table
- ✅ Fix RLS policies

### Step 2: Clear Browser Storage
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Under **Storage**, click **Clear site data**
4. This removes cached auth tokens that might be causing issues

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 (or 5174)
3. Try signing in with Google
4. Check browser console for detailed logs

## What Changed

### Before (Database Trigger)
- ❌ Trigger tried to insert into non-existent columns
- ❌ Complex database logic
- ❌ Hard to debug errors

### After (React-based)
- ✅ React code handles profile creation
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Easier to debug and modify
- ✅ Works with actual table structure

## Expected Result
- Clean OAuth redirect without errors
- User profile created automatically
- Console logs showing successful profile creation
- Access to the workout app immediately

## If Still Having Issues
1. Check Supabase **Authentication > Logs** for detailed errors
2. Check browser Network tab for failed API requests
3. Verify Google OAuth is enabled in Supabase **Authentication > Providers**
4. Ensure redirect URLs match in both Google Console and Supabase

## Current Status
- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ AuthContext updated with safe profile creation
- ⚠️ Need to run SQL fix in Supabase
- ⚠️ Need to test OAuth flow
